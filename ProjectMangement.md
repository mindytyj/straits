# Project Management Discussion

## Overall sentiments

* The team collaborated well together and provided positive feedback amongst members.

* Regular discussions were planned and held twice a week.

* Following each meeting, tasks were divided and assigned to team members.

* Team members communicated well and openly surfaced any issues which they encountered and assisted one another to overcome the challenges.
	
## Meeting Matters

* During our initial meetings, significant time was dedicated to discussing the features we would like to incorporate into our product and assessing how feasible each feature was.

* While we had the general idea of what features we would like to incorporate into our product, we recognised the importance of breaking them down into smaller, more achievable tasks.

* The team realised the value of task breakdown for better project management and execution.

## Communication within the team

* Our team does not currently face any communication issues.

* Everyone was open about the issues and difficulties they faced and seeked advice and guidance from other team members.

* There was substantial mutual support from everyone in the team.


## Sprint 1
* At First, we lack coding experience and spend more time as there is a need to truly understand the concepts. We initiated the project creating a backlog to document the issue we encountered. We are engaging in discussions on user stories that align with our project vision and we are focusing on creating a few User Persona and stories to guide our development process.

## Sprint 2 
* After careful consideration, we decided to use Python and Flask as our development environment. Since we were not initially familiar with these technologies, we invested more time in doing research to establish the entity relationship within our project. Following our learning phase with python, we begin creating console programs and insert into database concepts to align with our project vision.

## Sprint 3
* After this phase, we segmented tasks to initiate the construction of our project. However, we encounter issues establishing a connection with our database. We explored various templates to aid in the design of the web application. We focused on completing and running the project with additional research locally to align with our project vision.
