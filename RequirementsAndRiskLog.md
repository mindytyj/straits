## Risk Log
* Schedule Overruns - The activities we embark on during our project could extend past their expected durations. To counteract this challenge, we're streamlining our tasks to focus primarily on fulfilling client requirements. This strategy ensures that we meet the essential needs first before considering any enhancements to the product.
* Learning curve for Python - Team unfamiliarity with Python and Flask presents a significant learning curve, potentially slowing down progress. To mitigate this issue, we ensure that workload for each member is realistic and achievable, considering the learning curve. But still come to a collective goal, ensuring MVP is delivered by the dateline.
*Technical Debt Accumulation - In the rush to complete the MVP, best practice for our project may be overlooked, resulting in accumulated technical debt that complicates the development process. To mitigate this, we make sure time is allocated for us to learn python as a collective to share knowledge through discord so that we will have more time allocated on elevating our project for future sprints.
